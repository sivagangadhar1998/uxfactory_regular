global scope :a varibale declarde the top of a function or outside of function is called global varibles?
let a=10;
function greet(){

               console.log(a);
			   
			   } greet();
			   
			    
			   
			 let a ="hello";
			 function greet(){

this?this keyword refres global object (window)and it also refer to global objects and owner objects

var x= 1;
undefined
console.log(x);
VM286:1 1
undefined
this.x=10;
10
console.log(x);
VM363:1 10
undefined
alone this

var person = {
  firstName  : "John",
  lastName   : "Doe",
  id     : 5566,
  myFunction : function() {
    return this;
  }
};
undefined
person.myFunction()
{firstName: "John", lastName: "Doe", id: 5566, myFunction: Æ’}



methods
They can both be used to call an object method with another object as argument.
<script>
var person1 = {
  fullName: function() {
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
  }
}
var person2 = {
  firstName:"John",
  lastName: "Doe",
}
var x = person1.fullName.call(person2); 
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x; 
</script>



types of errors in js?
syntax errors and runtime errors andlogical errors , at the  compiling this are three errors 

method to prevent errors?
on error()method

.syntax errors are the most comman errors in programming language
.incorrect of syntax
.syntax errors also called parsing errors
. <script type=''text/javascript''>
    window.show(; ---missing closing bracket
  </script>
  
  
  .runtime
  These type of error occurs during the runtime of the program, after it is interpreted by the compiler.

Consider this code segment:

  <script type=''text/javascript''>
    window.show();
  </script>
Notice that there is no show function defined. This program will raise an error at runtime as the function which is not present is called, although the syntax is correct.


.logical erros





can return void in js?
The void operator evaluates the given expression and then returns undefined.
void function test() {
  console.log('boo!');
  // expected output: "boo!"
}();

try {
  test();
} catch (e) {
  console.log(e);
  // expected output: ReferenceError: test is not defined
}
